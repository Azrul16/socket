## üìù Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of Python for creating network applications using sockets. The problems involve:
- Implementing file transfer using TCP and UDP sockets.
- Creating a concurrent file server capable of handling multiple clients using multithreading.
- Developing a remote calculator service that performs arithmetic operations based on client requests.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- Python 3.6+
- Socket Programming
- Multithreading



## üß© Problem Descriptions

### Problem 1: Simple File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

**Description:**  
This solution implements a basic file transfer protocol using both TCP (connection-oriented) and UDP (connectionless) sockets. The client divides the file into chunks and sends them to the server. The server acknowledges receipt of each chunk (for TCP).

### Problem 2: Concurrent File Server with Multithreading

**Description:**  
This solution implements a concurrent file server that spawns a new thread for each client, allowing multiple clients to request files simultaneously.

### Problem 3: Remote Calculator Application

**Description:**  
The remote calculator allows the client to send two integers and an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /, %) to the server. The server performs the operation and sends back the result.
