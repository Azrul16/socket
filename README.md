🧩 Problem Descriptions
Problem 1: Simple File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
Description: This solution implements a basic file transfer protocol using both TCP (connection-oriented) and UDP (connectionless) sockets. The client divides the file into chunks and sends them to the server. The server acknowledges receipt of each chunk (for TCP).

Problem 2: Concurrent File Server with Multithreading
Description: This solution implements a concurrent file server that spawns a new thread for each client, allowing multiple clients to request files simultaneously.

Problem 3: Remote Calculator Application
Description: The remote calculator allows the client to send two integers and an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /, %) to the server. The server performs the operation and sends back the result.

🛠 Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
